## scatterbrain

Scatterbrain aims to be a spiritual child of [scatterize](http://webtasks.keck.waisman.wisc.edu/scatterize/d/Acdck0qHJo#h=2&m=OLS&x=1&y=6) and [NeuroSynth](http://neurosynth.org/). It'll allow researchers to upload files describing analyses (which were already done in some existing package), the data generating those analyses (nifti volumes and scalars), and the resulting statistical maps. (Possibly: a list of clusters or peaks of interest.)

Then, it'll allow reseachers to click around the brain, viewing scatterplots (or error bars if it isn't a continuous correlation?) at any voxel, and easily see outliers or such.
