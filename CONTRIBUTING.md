This project is planned as a proof-of-concept toy, written at a hackathon, which may someday be developed into a more full-fledged thing. My employer (the University of Wisconsin) is probably not interested in my working on it further.

The upshot: If you're interested in making this do something different than it does right now, you're probably on your own. I'd love to hear from you if you have any feedback at all (even if it's just "I can't get it to work") but I can't commit to fixing issues or merging PRs.

If you want to fork this and take it on as a serious project, go for it. It's MIT-licensed. I'd love to hear from you if you do that, but don't wait for my go-ahead.
